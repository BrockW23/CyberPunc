To understand my review you must first understand what a great game to me is..
A good game has emotion, story, visuals sure.. But a great game gives you the ability to experience all of those things for the first time in a new setting with a fresh unexpected mindset ready to be blown away. Experiencing feelings, euphorias, emotions throughout the game that are so familiar but so different at the same time. These games are rare!

Going into cyberpunk blind with no spoilers or really any idea of what the game is, gave me the best introduction to the game.

Cyberpunk 2077 is truly a action, adventure, RPG. Left me with a wow factor after 60hrs of gameplay time. Still excited to get home from work and see the story develop more.

Graphics are amazing 9.5/10
Talents and abilities are amazing 10/10
Story and character development is perfect 10/10
Quests and gameplay are immersive and keep you busy. 10/10
Side quest NPC background is just as immersive as the main story.
The full control over players decisions play a great roll in all of this. One of the best free-will gameplay scenarios I’ve ever seen. You actually grow relationships (good or bad) with these characters with an ever devolving backstory to each one. You feel every emotion you should to the characters. Every action you make plays a big roll in the long run in the constantly evolving story more than I’ve seen with any other game. Best way to describe the choice options in cyberpunk is “it’s not so much black or white choices, or A and B options all the time it goes deeper than your average rpg”.

This game goes on list with the best games I’ve ever played. Along with.
Farcry
Fallout
Elder scrolls
Mass effect
Red dead
GTA
Games like these only come around every so often so I suggest buying it, playing it, and enjoying it. 

(Don’t worry about what other people are saying when it comes to bugs/glitches/etc. every giant open world game has these and will be smoothed out over time. Take this game lightly and you will enjoy every second of it.)

Thank you Projekt Red for a great game to finish off 2020 with!
